# Written Report on the Neural Network Model

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to develop a deep learning model to predict the success of applications for Alphabet Soup, a non-profit organization. The goal is to identify the most promising applications based on various features provided in the dataset.

## Results

### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable:**
  - The target variable for the model is `IS_SUCCESSFUL`, which indicates whether the application was successful.

- **Feature Variables:**
  - The features for the model include all columns in the dataset except for `EIN`, `NAME`, and `IS_SUCCESSFUL`.

- **Removed Variables:**
  - The columns `EIN` and `NAME` were removed from the input data as they do not provide useful information for the model.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Model Architecture:**
  - **Neurons:** The models used hidden layers with configurations of 256, 128, and 64 neurons.
  - **Layers:** Each model included three hidden layers and one output layer.
  - **Activation Functions:** ReLU activation was used for hidden layers, and sigmoid activation was used for the output layer.

- **Model Performance:**
  - **Adam Optimized Model Accuracy:** 72.42%
  - **RMSprop Optimized Model Accuracy:** 72.93%
  - **Adam with Dropout Optimized Model Accuracy:** 72.45%

- **Steps to Improve Performance:**
  - Implemented a variety of optimizers (Adam and RMSprop) and adjusted learning rates.
  - Added dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
  - Increased complexity of hidden layers.

### Summary

The deep learning models achieved accuracies ranging from 72.42% to 72.93%. While these results are improvements, they do not meet the desired threshold of 75% accuracy.

**Recommendations for Improvement:**

1. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use automated hyperparameter tuning to find optimal settings for learning rate, number of neurons, and dropout rates.
2. **Advanced Architectures:** Experiment with more complex neural network architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) if the dataset's nature suggests such approaches.
3. **Ensemble Methods:** Consider combining multiple models to improve overall performance.

Implementing these recommendations could potentially increase the model's accuracy to meet or exceed the 75% threshold.
